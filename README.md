# keyboard-layouts
This repository is for keeping my keyboard layouts and scripts handy on new
computers.

## Svorak A5
The svorak layout (`layouts/svoraka5`) should be put in
`/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols` so it can be loaded by the `svoraka5.sh` script.

All credit for the layout itself goes to [magnus](mailto:magnus@aoeu.info) @
[aoeu.info](http://aoeu.info) (Swedish site). Information about Svorak and its
variants can be found on that site.
